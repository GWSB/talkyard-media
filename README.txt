Here are images and videos (and sound?) used in built in Talkyard tutorials and wizards and stuff. (Talkyard: https://github.com/debiki/talkyard)

Could move all icon fonts, and PNG arrows, to here, too? I.e. `modules/fontello` and `public/res/img`.

All this stuff is in its own repository, so if it grows large because people add too many videos and stuff, and there're old videos no longer in use in the Git history â€” then this repo can be squashed, and made small again. Without affecting the main repo with all source code (it just needs to be updated to link to the new history-squashed version of this repo).
